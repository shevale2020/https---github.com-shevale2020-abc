Hi,

The marital status has been updated on the system and the wedding voucher will be processed within 2 months.


To get your spouse added as a dependent please update the dependent data.
WNS Intranet > eSpace > hYve - HR Application portal > hYve > Classic home tab > > Self Service > Personal Information > Personal Relationships > Dependent Data
Once the above request is done please write a mail to HR.Connect@wns.com along with the wedding card/ marriage certificate and DOB proof of your spouse to get the details updated on the system.
For clarity on the same please give us a call on IP 47247 or Land Line 020-41286841/15 .
Regards,
Aditya K
